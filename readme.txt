Hi,

I have covered all the functional aspects, and have kept the styling to a bare minimum.
I have opted for the dropdown type pagination because the bottom bar pagination requires lot of styling.

Since use of libraries were not allowed, I have included images for sorting instead of icons.

The project will have to run on a server, else cross-origin domain will be an issue

Regards,
Melroy
